Statistics
==================


*How to get statistics?*

https://<address-montra>/api/statistics/portal/all/all/dateStart/dateEnd

Example:
http://localhost:8000/api/statistics/portal/all/all/2016-11-15/2017-01-15


*How to extend the model?*


Our idea is to create PDF with statistics or output file.

If you want to create new statistics, you can extend the services.py and also
create new templates (html) for new pdfs.
