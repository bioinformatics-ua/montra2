Study Manager
=============================================

This module is designed for managing the study requests. 

A study request is a generic entity associated to a community through which users can request
information and study managers can provide that information. 

Study Requests can be integrated as a third-party application/plugin.
The plugin has to be named "Study Requests" and can be added as:
http://localhost:8000/studies/display_studies/
